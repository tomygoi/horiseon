# Horiseon Social Services

##Description 
This project was done as the first on-the-job ticket which we were tasked with refactoring exisiting code. The overall goal of this challenge was to make the webpage more accessible for users. This would include implementation of semantic html, adding alt tags for the visually impaired, condensing redundant code, etc. The work involved in refactoring the starter code allowed for further understanding of semantic html format and its benefits in organization as well as improving upon CSS styles and its cascading structure. 

##Usage
